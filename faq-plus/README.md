Chatbots on Microsoft Teams are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in a meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails to answer a question well.

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. A user can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot offers the user an option to "Ask an expert", which posts the question to a pre-configured team of experts to provide support. An expert can assign the question to themself, chat with the user to gain more context.

## FAQ
Here're some frequently met errors when running this sample:

### The provided value for the template parameter 'configAppClientId' at line xxx and column xxx is not valid.
This is because `configAppClientId` is not correctly set in `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{envName}.json`. Please follow this [instruction](docs/deploy-qna-maker-services.md#step-1-register-azure-ad-applications) to create an Azure AD app and config related values to `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{envName}.json`.

### Only one free account is allowed for account type 'QnAMaker'.
Deploy 'QnAMaker' service will automatically create a free account. This error indicates that your subscription has an existing free QnAMaker account, perhaps due to other 'QnAMaker' service previously deployed. You can either delete the existing free account if it's not in use, or create a paid QnAMaker account by setting the value of `qnaMakerSku` in `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.{envName}.json` to `S0`.
> Note: Changing the SKU will impact the cost of your subscription. Please review the changes carefully.
